          <p>(Blacksmith Shop) (Marty arrives in town. He jumps off his horse and runs into Doc's shop.) Doc! Doc! (Realizing that Doc isn't there he runs back outside. He looks around and spots the Saloon.) (Saloon)Doc. (Main Street) (Marty hits 88 MPH and disappears into the future.) Yeah!! (Main Street - 1985)Oh yes, well, excuse us Clara, we have to get...going. Toodle-oo. (Doc waves at Clara and she waves back before going inside. Doc and Marty get on their horses and ride away.) What do ya mean, you're gonna be seein' lots of her, Doc? Well...I might see her again, just in passing. (laughs) C'mon, Doc, did you see the way she was looking at you?Calmly. Marty...we all have to make decisions that affect the course of our lives. You've gotta do what you've gotta do. And I've gotta do what I've gotta do. (leaves) (Railroad Tracks - Night) (Marty is working on something when Doc walks over and stoops down to talk to him.) Marty. Yeah?Oh, Emmett, won't you come in? No...I better not. I... What's wrong? I've come to say goodbye. Goodbye? Well, where ya goin'?(Marty keeps his feet going. When the dust clears we see that he's doing Michael Jackson's moonwalk.) Uh...uh...Billy Jean is not my lover-kicking feet-whoo! (He does a spin and a jump at the end, and manages to jump on a loose wooden plank. At the other end of the plank is a barrel full of tobacco spit, and it goes flying and spills all over Tannen. Tannen draws his gun and pulls the trigger, but luckily enough for Marty, Tannen is out of bullets. Marty hurries to get out of the saloon but he trips and hits the old men's table.) You better run, squirrel! Y'all get him!!!</p>
